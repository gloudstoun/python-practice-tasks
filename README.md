# Python Practice Tasks

This repository contains my solutions to various Python programming tasks and exercises. It serves as a personal learning journey and a collection of small programs covering fundamental Python concepts.

The goal of this repository is to:
* Practice core Python programming principles.
* Strengthen problem-solving skills.
* Organize code by topic for easy reference.

## Folder Structure and Topics

The tasks are organized into the following categories:

* **`basic_concepts/`**: Exercises covering fundamental Python syntax, variables, data types, user input, and basic operators.
* **`control_flow/`**: Programs demonstrating conditional statements (`if/else/elif`), various types of loops (`for`, `while`), and logical flow control.
* **`data_structures/`**: Tasks focused on manipulating Python's built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
* **`functions_and_modules/`**: Examples of defining and using functions, understanding function arguments, and basic module/package creation (like `math_utils`).
* **`algorithms_and_logic/`**: Solutions to common algorithmic problems, mathematical calculations, string manipulation (e.g., word/vowel counting, palindromes), and general problem-solving logic.
* **`file_operations/`**: Programs demonstrating how to read from and write to files.
* **`oop_basics/`**: Exercises exploring Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstract methods.
* **`error_handling/`**: Examples of using `try-except` blocks for graceful error management and exception handling.
